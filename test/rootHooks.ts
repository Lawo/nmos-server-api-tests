// You may also pick any file and add “root”-level hooks. For example, add beforeEach()
// outside of all describe() blocks. This will cause the callback to beforeEach() to run 
// before any test case, regardless of the file it lives in (this is because Mocha has an 
// implied describe() block, called the “root suite”).

beforeEach(() => {
  // console.log('before every test in every file');
});
