// You may also pick any file and add “root”-level hooks. For example, add beforeEach() outside of all describe() blocks. This will cause the callback to beforeEach() to run before any test case, regardless of the file it lives in (this is because Mocha has an implied describe() block, called the “root suite”).

beforeEach(function() {
  // console.log('before every test in every file');
});
